Analysis
Domain:
A fleet has multiple boats
- Each boat has type, name, year, make/model, length, purchase price, and money spent
- The system can load boats from a CSV file or a saved database file
- A user can print, add, remove, and authorize expenses for boats
Function points:
- Start the program and load the fleet
- Show a menu for user actions
- Print the full fleet report
- Add a new boat using a CSV input line
- Remove a boat by name
- Spend money on a boat (if allowed)
- Save all boats before exiting
Scenarios:
- Program starts with boats already loaded
- User adds a new boat and it appears in the list
- User removes a boat and it disappears from the list
- Expense approved (enough money left)
- Expense denied (not enough money left)
- Invalid menu input prints error message
- Trying to remove or spend on a boat that doesn’t exist prints an error
